{
  "plexus": ". Ganglion clusters with large and pale nuclei: Interspersed nerve fibers (wavy, eosinophilic); supporting glial cells (small, dark nuclei); located between inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers; sparse connective tissue matrix; distinct from densely packed smooth muscle surroundings. Clustered large neuronal cell bodies with prominent nucleoli: Reticular stromal fiber networks; heterogeneous tissue texture with mixed cell densities; focal disruption of smooth muscle continuity; localized presence of glial support cells; distinct basophilic or eosinophilic staining variations; nodular architecture interrupting muscular uniformity",
  "no plexus": ". Uniform and continuous muscular layers with indistinct connective tissue borders: Absence of neural aggregates or ganglionic clusters between smooth muscle fibers; homogeneous stromal composition lacking specialized cellular networks; smooth, uninterrupted interfaces between longitudinal and circular muscle bands; inconspicuous interstitial cell populations; unremarkable vascular patterns without adjacent organized cellular arrangements. Absence of ganglion cells in submucosa and muscularis propria: Large neuronal cells missing in typical locations; hypertrophic nerve fibers; thickened, eosinophilic nerve bundles within the submucosa or muscular layers; increased density of small nerve bundles; clusters of irregular nerve structures in affected areas; thickened muscularis propria; hyperplastic smooth muscle layers with altered orientation; abrupt transition from aganglionic to ganglionic segments; narrow lumen proximal to the affected zone with dilated normal colon distally; secondary mucosal inflammation; neutrophilic infiltrates or cryptitis near aganglionic regions; mucosal ulceration or erosions due to obstruction"
