  "plexus": {
    "Clustered large nuclei with prominent nucleoli": "Fine, wavy fibrous mesh structures; organized cellular clusters surrounded by supporting cells; thickened nerve bundles adjacent to cellular aggregates; specific immunohistochemical staining patterns",
    "Ganglion cell clusters (large nuclei, prominent nucleoli)": "Looser stromal matrix vs. dense muscle bundles; lower cellular density with interspersed nerve fibers; eosinophilic cytoplasm contrast to spindle-shaped myocytes; nodular/network architecture vs. linear muscle alignment; distinct nuclear morphology (round vs. elongated); supporting glial cell presence; vascularity variations; staining contrast in H&E (lighter vs. uniform)"

  "no plexus": {
    "Enlarged, densely packed nerve fibers without clustered nuclei": "Increased density of linear, disorganized fibers; absence of organized cellular clusters; thickened muscular layers with sparse cellularity; inflammatory cell aggregates obscuring tissue architecture; submucosal layer thinning or reduced cellularity; excessive connective tissue deposition; lack of immunohistochemical staining in expected regions",
    "Absence of clustered ganglion cells": "Uniform smooth muscle layers lacking neural structures; sparse vascular networks without branching complexity; homogeneous mucosal architecture lacking specialized zones; minimal inflammatory infiltrates disrupting tissue organization; fibrosis obscuring normal stromal patterns; thickened muscularis propria without interspersed neural elements; lack of spindle-shaped interstitial cells between muscle fibers; reduced neuronal process density in submucosal and myenteric regions",
    "Absence of ganglion cells": "No clusters of large, pale-staining cells between smooth muscle layers; hypertrophic nerve fibers thickened, eosinophilic strands in submucosa and muscularis; increased nerve bundle size enlarged, irregularly contoured bundles within intermuscular regions; smooth muscle hypertrophy thickened inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers; inflammatory infiltrates lymphocytes or eosinophils in muscularis or submucosa; fibrosis collagen deposition in muscularis, appearing as dense, acellular areas; mucosal alterations crypt atrophy or ulceration secondary to obstruction; transition zone abrupt histological shift from aganglionic to normal bowel with sudden nerve density reduction"
