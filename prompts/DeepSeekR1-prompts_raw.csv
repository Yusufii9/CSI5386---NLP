0,patch,plexus,"Clustered large nuclei with prominent nucleoli: Fine, wavy fibrous mesh structures; organized cellular clusters surrounded by supporting cells; thickened nerve bundles adjacent to cellular aggregates; specific immunohistochemical staining patterns"
1,patch,no plexus,"Enlarged, densely packed nerve fibers without clustered nuclei: Increased density of linear, disorganized fibers; absence of organized cellular clusters; thickened muscular layers with sparse cellularity; inflammatory cell aggregates obscuring tissue architecture; submucosal layer thinning or reduced cellularity; excessive connective tissue deposition; lack of immunohistochemical staining in expected regions"
2,patch,no plexus,Absence of clustered ganglion cells: Uniform smooth muscle layers lacking neural structures; sparse vascular networks without branching complexity; homogeneous mucosal architecture lacking specialized zones; minimal inflammatory infiltrates disrupting tissue organization; fibrosis obscuring normal stromal patterns; thickened muscularis propria without interspersed neural elements; lack of spindle-shaped interstitial cells between muscle fibers; reduced neuronal process density in submucosal and myenteric regions
3,patch,plexus,"Ganglion cell clusters (large nuclei, prominent nucleoli): Looser stromal matrix vs. dense muscle bundles; lower cellular density with interspersed nerve fibers; eosinophilic cytoplasm contrast to spindle-shaped myocytes; nodular/network architecture vs. linear muscle alignment; distinct nuclear morphology (round vs. elongated); supporting glial cell presence; vascularity variations; staining contrast in H&E (lighter vs. uniform)"
4,patch,no plexus,"Absence of ganglion cells: No clusters of large, pale-staining cells between smooth muscle layers; hypertrophic nerve fibers: thickened, eosinophilic strands in submucosa and muscularis; increased nerve bundle size: enlarged, irregularly contoured bundles within intermuscular regions; smooth muscle hypertrophy: thickened inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers; inflammatory infiltrates: lymphocytes or eosinophils in muscularis or submucosa; fibrosis: collagen deposition in muscularis, appearing as dense, acellular areas; mucosal alterations: crypt atrophy or ulceration secondary to obstruction; transition zone: abrupt histological shift from aganglionic to normal bowel with sudden nerve density reduction"
5,slide,plexus,"Ganglion clusters with large and pale nuclei: Interspersed nerve fibers (wavy, eosinophilic); supporting glial cells (small, dark nuclei); located between inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers; sparse connective tissue matrix; distinct from densely packed smooth muscle surroundings"
6,slide,no plexus,"Uniform and continuous muscular layers with indistinct connective tissue borders: Absence of neural aggregates or ganglionic clusters between smooth muscle fibers; homogeneous stromal composition lacking specialized cellular networks; smooth, uninterrupted interfaces between longitudinal and circular muscle bands; inconspicuous interstitial cell populations; unremarkable vascular patterns without adjacent organized cellular arrangements"
7,slide,plexus,Clustered large neuronal cell bodies with prominent nucleoli: Reticular stromal fiber networks; heterogeneous tissue texture with mixed cell densities; focal disruption of smooth muscle continuity; localized presence of glial support cells; distinct basophilic or eosinophilic staining variations; nodular architecture interrupting muscular uniformity
8,slide,no plexus,"Absence of ganglion cells in submucosa and muscularis propria: Large neuronal cells missing in typical locations; hypertrophic nerve fibers; thickened, eosinophilic nerve bundles within the submucosa or muscular layers; increased density of small nerve bundles; clusters of irregular nerve structures in affected areas; thickened muscularis propria; hyperplastic smooth muscle layers with altered orientation; abrupt transition from aganglionic to ganglionic segments; narrow lumen proximal to the affected zone with dilated normal colon distally; secondary mucosal inflammation; neutrophilic infiltrates or cryptitis near aganglionic regions; mucosal ulceration or erosions due to obstruction"
